## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built using the following cutting-edge technologies and tools:

- **Node.js**: The heart of our backend, ensuring fast and scalable server-side operations.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for building APIs with ease.
- **GraphQL**: The query language that makes fetching data as smooth as butter.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores sensor data in a flexible and scalable way.
- **Mongoose**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables securely.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

## üí° What This Project Does

The **Siemens Sensor Project** is a backend API that allows you to:

1. **Add Sensor Data**: Store sensor readings like temperature, humidity, etc., along with their units and timestamps.
2. **Retrieve Sensor Data**: Fetch sensor data using GraphQL queries.
3. **Manage Sensor Data**: Easily extend the API to update or delete sensor data.

### **The Idea Behind This Project**
In a world where IoT devices are everywhere, managing sensor data efficiently is crucial. This project provides a scalable and developer-friendly solution to handle sensor data, making it ideal for IoT applications, smart homes, and industrial automation.

## üß™ How to Test Locally

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MUSKAN07072000/sensor-project.git
cd sensor-project

2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:
npm install
3. Set Up MongoDB
Install MongoDB on your system if you haven‚Äôt already. Download MongoDB.
Start the MongoDB server:mongod
Create a database named siemens-sensor-project (or use the default setup).
4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:
MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME=siemens-sensor-project
5. Start the Server
Run the following command to start the server:
node [app.js](http://_vscodecontentref_/1)
The server will be running at http://localhost:4000. Access the GraphQL Playground at http://localhost:4000/graphql.

6. Test the API
Use the GraphQL Playground to test the following mutation:
mutation {
  addSensor(
    sensorId: "sensor001",
    sensorType: "temperature",
    value: 25.5,
    unit: "¬∞C"
  ) {
    sensorId
    sensorType
    value
    unit
    timestamp
  }
}
ü§î Why This Tech Stack?
Node.js + Express.js
Fast, scalable, and perfect for building APIs.
The asynchronous nature of Node.js ensures non-blocking operations, making it ideal for handling multiple sensor data requests.
GraphQL
Why settle for REST when you can have GraphQL? Fetch exactly what you need, no more, no less.
Perfect for IoT applications where data requirements can vary.
MongoDB + Mongoose
MongoDB‚Äôs flexible schema is perfect for storing diverse sensor data.
Mongoose makes interacting with MongoDB a breeze, with built-in validation and schema modeling.
dotenv
Because hardcoding credentials is so 2010. Securely manage environment variables like a pro.
üéØ Why This Project Stands Out
Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of sensor data effortlessly.
Developer-Friendly: With GraphQL, developers can query exactly what they need.
Future-Ready: Built with modern tools and frameworks, making it easy to extend and maintain.
Humor-Infused: Because coding should be fun, right? üòâ
